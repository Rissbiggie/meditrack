Running AgriConnect on Your Computer
To run the AgriConnect application on your local computer, you'll need the following software and complete these steps:

Required Software:
Node.js (v16 or newer) - The JavaScript runtime that powers the application
npm (Node Package Manager) - Comes with Node.js installation
PostgreSQL Database (v13 or newer) - For storing application data
Git - For cloning the repository (optional, but recommended)
Step-by-Step Setup Guide:
1. Install Required Software
Node.js & npm: Download and install from nodejs.org
PostgreSQL:
Download from postgresql.org
During installation, note your password and port (default is 5432)
2. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgriConnect.git
cd AgriConnect
3. Configure Database
Create a PostgreSQL database for the application:

psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE agriconnect;
\q
4. Set Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root with the following content:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/agriconnect
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
Replace yourpassword with your PostgreSQL password.

5. Install Dependencies
npm install
6. Push Database Schema
npm run db:push
This will create all the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.

7. Start the Application
npm run dev
This will start the application on http://localhost:5000

Accessing the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:5000
You should see the AgriConnect login page. You can either:

Register a new account
Use one of the demo accounts (if they've been created)
Troubleshooting
If you encounter database connection issues, verify your PostgreSQL service is running and check the DATABASE_URL in your .env file
If the application doesn't start, check that ports 5000 is not being used by another application
For any Node.js errors, ensure you're using a compatible version (16+)
